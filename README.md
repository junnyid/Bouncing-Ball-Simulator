# Bouncing-Ball-Simulator
I used Tkinter library. Tkinter is an open-source Python Graphic User Interface (GUI). Python when combined with Tkinter provides a fast and easy way to create GUI application. It provides a powerful object-oriented interface to the Tk GUI tookit. Tkinter cannot be used for larger - scale project.

1. I created the screen with width = 800 and height = 500

2. The init method or constructors include: canvas, speed, radius, color, initX, initY are parameter

3. Creating a circle with variables

4. This move the ball to x, y coordinates
Get the position of the ball: If ball get to edge then we need to change direction of movement

5. Then init list ball

6. I check the distance between the balls. If the distance between the center of the two balls is less than the sum of the radius of the balls, then they are colliding.
